# Project Overview
The Sentiment Analysis project utilizes the IMDB dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews for natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics. This dataset is used for binary sentiment classification, providing 25,000 highly polarized movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. The goal of the project is to predict the sentiment of movie reviews as either positive or negative using machine learning algorithms.
